### Key Architectural Patterns

#### **Dual-Gateway Design**
```
External Traffic ‚Üí Envoy AI Gateway ‚Üí Istio Gateway ‚Üí KServe Models
     (Tier-1)            (Tier-2)         (Serving)
```
- **Tier-1 (AI Gateway)**: AI-specific routing, JWT authentication, OpenAI protocol translation
- **Tier-2 (Service Mesh)**: mTLS encryption, traffic policies, service discovery

#### **Multi-Tenant Architecture**
- Complete namespace isolation (`tenant-a`, `tenant-b`, `tenant-c`)
- Separate resource quotas, policies, and observability scopes
- Tenant-specific security boundaries with Istio authorization policies

#### **Serverless Model Serving**
- Auto-scaling from zero to handle varying workloads
- Support for multiple ML frameworks (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face)
- OpenAI-compatible API endpoints for LLM models
